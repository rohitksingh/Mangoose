    <string name="lorem">I need to change a TextView´s left margin instead of its size depending on parent layout´s width. Using your code it works more or less, but it gives me strange results when using it in the rows of a ListView, i. e. it´s not always in the correct position after scrolling. Do I have to override another method? How should I call setMeasuredDimension in this case?</string>
